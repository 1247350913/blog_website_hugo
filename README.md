# nocomment - an educational blog

RETIRED - replaced with DayOne for better quick note writing on mobile

This is a blog where I share my thoughts freely and without mediation and concern of violating community guidelines. I do it as personal therapy and with hopes of inspiring other deep thinkers to think more critically and be more realistic.
