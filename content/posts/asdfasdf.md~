I had a chance to fly down to Arizona for the weekend to attend a wedding. The wedding ceremony was scheduled for the following dat at 2 p.m., outside, and in direct sunlight. It was to be held at a public park with plenty going on all around the wedding.

Ideally, I would have liked to pack off camera lighting, but I don't think blasting the bride and groom with a ton of flash during the ceremony would be appreciated. Also, due to space constraints I wouldn't be able to pack enough gear. Moreover, I only own one off camera flash at this time.

Rather than packing everything, I opted for my ThinkTank Retrospective 7 V2.0, Canon R5, 70-200mm f/2.8 RF, 28-70mm f/2 RF, M1 MacBook Pro, chargers, adapters, etc. All of that fit in the bag and easily under the seat in front of me on the plane.

More about that bag here:

The night before the wedding, we only had 30 minutes to shoot before the sun went down. The light was changing fast, no time to think, just pick a bunch of areas on a nearby walking path, try a bunch of different ideas, and work fast!

I edited them using Capture One Pro 22 and Exposure X7.

Here are the results.
